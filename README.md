pyqdb-tests
===========

Just playing with [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org) amd making quote database.

####What is pyqdb?
It's just a simple project written in python3 with cherrypy. I made it because I was bored and wanted to 
try something new. I don't know how did you get here, but I know that it's not what you're looking for.

In my opinion CherryPy is interesting, but isn't suitable for apps like that (unless you have a lot of time or know 
cherrypy and have tools/plugins). If I have to do real qdb, I will go with django. 

**pyqdb is NOT working, it's just my playground**
